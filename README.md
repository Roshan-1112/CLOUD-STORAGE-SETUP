IN This task I have CREATED AND CONFIGURED CLOUD STORAGE ON AWS S3,were i have used aws console free tier account to access s3 services that is simple storage system.I have used s3 buckets to create the storage, were we can upload the files in the bucket which acts as an cloud drive. It is useful for storing,maintaining and monitoring large files and data in a personal storage. This bucket storage can used by students for research purpose, company's for their projects and many others.This cloud storage gives us large amount of storage space with free of cost were it is available for free tier service in aws console website.
